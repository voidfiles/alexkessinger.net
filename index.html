    <div class="block">
        <p>I have been a front-end engineer at Yahoo for the past two years. Working at <a href="http://tech.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Tech</a>, then <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Mail</a>, and now <a href="http://music.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Music</a>. Before that I spent more then 10 years hacking on a variety of personal projects.</p>
        <p>My profesional, as well as pearsonal mission, is too never stop learning, and I always work with an intention of getting better at what I do. Even when working on one-off projects, learning, or trying something new is important to me.</p>
        <p>I am always on the look out for a fun new project to try, that will teach me something.</p>
